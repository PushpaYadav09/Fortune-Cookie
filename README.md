# Fortune-Cookie

A fun, mysterious web app that reveals your fortune when you click a glowing fortune cookie. Styled with a magical theme using deep purples and blues.

## 🌟 Features

- Random fortune message every time you click the cookie
- Mystic-themed UI with glowing effects
- Smooth animations and hover interactions
- Simple and responsive design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## 💻 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with custom fonts and gradients)
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- Google Fonts

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Make sure the folder contains the following files:
    ```
    fortune-cookie/
    ├── index.html
    ├── style.css
    ├── script.js
    └── cookie.png
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

> Optional: Install the Live Server extension in VS Code for auto-reloading during development.

## 🧠 How It Works

- An array of random fortune messages is defined in `script.js`.
- When the user clicks the cookie image, a message is selected randomly and displayed on the screen.
- Styling in `style.css` creates a mystical atmosphere using gradients, glowing text, and animations.
